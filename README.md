# Signal Desktop

**REGISTERING A NEW DEVICE WILL DELETE THE OLD ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER**

This Signal Desktop fork can be used without a smartphone.

---

This is a hobby project and I am no frontend developer nor a security expert in any way. Nevertheless I am using this fork myself and am trying to keep it up to date with the upstream master branch. This project can not be considered finished, but a minimal usage is covered. Here is a brief overview about what is currently possible:

### Features

- Register Signal-Desktop as a standalone device.
  - This option is part of the official Signal-Desktop (only in development mode) and can therefore be considered rather stable
- Changing a contact's name
- Linking a secondary Signal-Desktop instance to the primary one
- One-Way Synchronization accross multiple devices. This is similar to the synchronization mechanism between Signal-Android/iOS and Signal-Desktop.
  - Any changes made in the secondary devices will be overwritten upon next synchronization
- Changing privacy settings
  - Read Receipts
  - Unidentified Delivery Indicators
  - Typing Indicators
  - Link Previews
